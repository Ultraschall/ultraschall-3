# Ultraschall -- Your companion through the badlands of podcasting software

## Design

Ultraschall aspires to a simple, minimalist impression. Distracting ornaments are unwelcome. Thus, we rigorously removed superfluous or redundant icons and menu entries.

## Guided by workflow

Podcasters produce in a completely different way than musicians. We usually have the three phases of preparation, (live) show and post-production. Ultraschall's program composition let's you switch between the respective views back and forth easily.

## Podcast features

Functions that are useful for us podcasters are prominently placed: setting and naming chapter markers, as well as their export to [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com/) and [Podlove](http://podlove.org/), routing presets for pre-show and (live) show, a Soundboard for audio shorts, ripple editing to keep tracks in sync, and so much more.

## Multi-functional dock

You can select various tools from the dock, and order them to your liking: track mixer, `Master Mixer`, `Media Explorer`, `Navigator`, `Region/Marker Manager`, `Routing Matrix`, routing preset, `FX Browser` and `Big Clock`. Moreover,  you decide whether to divide the doc into two or three parts, and how to arrange the tools.

## Soundboard

The function `Remove silence` enables the separation of audio inserts -- for example from the Soundboard -- so that only these inserts remain on the track. They can be marked with `Chapter marker foo`.

## Chapter markers

Your chapter markers are positioned to millisecond accuracy, and you can organize them into groups. Exporting to clipboard, to file or to a custom format enables the quick usage in [Auphonic](https://auphonic.com/) and [Podlove](http://podlove.org/).

## Variable playback

Want to make your post-production more efficient? Just increase the playback speed! Tone pitch remains constant, of course.

## Cough buttons

OSC tools ([OSCulator](http://www.osculator.net/), [touchOSC](http://hexler.net/software/touchosc)) can be used as remotes during recording. Thus, chapter markers can be set live. Muting automation is possible via cough buttons, e.g. on a [Wiimote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote) or iPad.

## Routing presets

We pre-defined some useful routing presets, which you can activate with a single click. Es easy as on a digital mixing console! You can seamlessly switch between pre-show (only music to the livestream, but all podcasters can already hear each other and warm up), show (everything to the stream), post-show (low carpet of music) and cutting (nothing to the stream). You can also configure and save your own routing presets.

## Effects

Ultraschall gives podcasters easy access to essential effects : expander (composed of soft gate, compressor and limiter) and parametric EQ. These effects are non-destructive and you can adjust them per track at any time.

## VU meter

Large VU meters with peak display (numerical as well) enable the perfect amp drive. The target range of -18dB to -6dB is distinctly colored  (yellow).

## Views

Ultraschall offers three preset window and tool arrangements for the workflow steps of preparation, show and post-production. Customize these presets at will and define more (including icons and short-cuts)!

## Routing matrix for N-1 circuits

The routing matrix is a core concept of Ultraschall besides the workflow views. Only few can afford a digital mixing console for 1,000 $ or more, and that won't be necessary anymore anyway. But already with a digital audio interface starting at 150 $ you get goodies like latency free listening, cable-free [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)- or [Mumble](http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page)-circuits, as well as live jingles. Each of your shows can begin in seconds, once you saved its routing preset in a template.

## Color coding

Although we strive for a minimalist, neutral impression, you can colorize tracks can by group or individually. This ensures a quick overview of present speakers, [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) or [Mumble](http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) guests, jingles, etc.

## Ripple editing

Ripple editing guarantees that even during complex cutting in post-production, tracks remain in sync with each other. Moreover, already set chapter markers remain correctly in place.
