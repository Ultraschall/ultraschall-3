This is a bug and feature tracker, please only use it to report bugs or request features within Ultraschall and NOT REAPER.

Do not seek support here ("I need help with ...", "I have a question ..."), that belongs on the community forum at https://sendegate.de/c/ultraschall, NOT here.

Mark requests with a "[Request]" prefix in the title please. For bug reports fully fill out the bug reporting template below.

When reporting a bug do NOT delete ANY lines from the template.

Make sure any bug you want to report is still present with the CURRENT Ultraschall version and that it does not vanish when you upgrade to the current version of Ultraschall.

Thank you!
